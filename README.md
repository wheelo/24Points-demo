# webpack-config
24Points Game using Javascript and websocket. This works as the first demo for my `webpack-config` project.

## The 24Points Game
You are randomly given four digits, each from one to nine, with repetitions allowed.
The goal is to enter an expression that evaluates to 24.

Tips:

Only multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction operators/functions are allowed.
Division should use floating point or rational arithmetic, etc, to preserve remainders.
Brackets are allowed, if using an infix expression evaluator.
Forming multiple digit numbers from the supplied digits is disallowed. (So an answer of 12+12 when given 1, 2, 2, and 1 is wrong).
The order of the digits when given does not have to be preserved.

## Usage
The technology stack is consisted of ES2015 + less + websocket. 

Enjoy~
